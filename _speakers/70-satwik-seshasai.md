Dr. Satwik Seshasai is the founding Chief Technology Officer at Segovia, a financial technology company that is making it easy for organizations to pay anyone, anytime, anywhere in the emerging markets. While a recent entrant to the market, Segovia is currently facilitating millions of payments across eight different markets in Africa and more recently, Asia; these payments not only include traditional corporate payments, but also social program payments to the extreme poor in some of the most remote locations(e.g., post-Ebola relief in Liberia; refugee payments in Nigeria and Niger).

In his initial role at Segovia, Satwik led all aspects of technology development, including recruiting early technical leaders behind Facebook’s internationalization team, Google’s search query monetization and Palantir’s expansion into commercial work. He more recently took over sales and business development, and works directly with leading NGOs, donor agencies, agriculture companies, and others who are focused on digitizing payments in the emerging markets.

He has also participated in numerous initiatives in the space, including collaborating on the World Economic Forum’s Principles on Humanitarian Payments and serving on working groups for UN OCHA and UNHCR.

Prior to Segovia, in almost a decade at IBM focusing on cloud computing and collaboration, he led the creation of multiple new products leading global teams up to 120, while concurrently pursuing an academic career at MIT which combined engineering and management disciplines. He has patented technology which brings social networking into the enterprise. He left IBM to drive the growth of NextDocs, one of INC500’s top 10 software companies in the country, building a Compliance Platform for over 100 top clients in the life sciences and other highly regulated industries.

His PhD is in Engineering Systems, a program at MIT combining technology, management and policy, with field work in Kenya and Abu Dhabi. His academic research developed new technical and managerial methods for using social networking in decision making, global product development and corporate strategy, all of which has been published in leading technical and management journals.
