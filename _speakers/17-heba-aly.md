Heba runs the news service www.irinnews.org, one of the world’s leading sources of original, field-based journalism about humanitarian crises. A multimedia journalist by training, Heba spent one decade reporting from conflict zones in the Middle East, Africa and Central Asia before moving into management. Her work for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the Christian Science Monitor, Bloomberg News and IRIN, among others, took her to places like Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Chad and Libya; and she received a grant from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting for her work in northern Sudan.

Heba has worked with IRIN in different capacities since 2007, including as field correspondent and Middle East Editor, and played a key role in planning and executing IRIN’s spin-off from the United Nations to become an independent media organization.  She is a regular commentator on humanitarian policy in her published work, in governmental briefings and at conferences around the world. Heba speaks English, French, Arabic and Spanish.
