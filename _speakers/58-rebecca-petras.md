The ‘participation revolution’ in humanitarian response requires a re-think on how we communicate, and, more specifically, in what languages. If we are truly letting go and allowing affected populations to lead response in the way that makes sense for them, then we need to consider simple yet critical factors: Are we listening to voices that are in languages we don’t understand? Are we sure our messages are comprehended and appropriate? Are we using content coming from the affected popuIations that might be better suited to the response? Can the affected population effectively access messaging and content? These are the questions I’m asking, looking for technology solutions to answer some of them.
