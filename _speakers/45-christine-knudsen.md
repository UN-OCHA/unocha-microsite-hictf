Christine Knudsen joined Sphere as the Director in November 2014, bringing with her nearly 20 years of experience balanced between UN and NGO assignments, field response and policy development, focusing on operational collaboration.  As the chief of UNICEF’s humanitarian partnerships in Geneva, she worked on improving frameworks for working with UNHCR, ICRC, NGOs, and within the IASC.  During her tenure with OCHA, she developed the innovative ProCap project to train protection specialists to be deployed to any of six UN agencies around the world.  During her earlier six years with Save the Children, she led front line child protection responses in Sudan, Somalia, Chad, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Mozambique, Aceh, Sierra Leone among others, expanding the agency’s work to include prevention of trafficking and recruitment into armed groups.  She worked with UNHCR as the programme officer for Chechnya and the North Caucasus (1997-1999), with the National Democratic Institute in the Gambia (1996) and with CRS in Burundi on community reconciliation initiatives (1995-6).   Christine holds an MA in International Relations from Johns Hopkins-SAIS, a licence in Literature from the Sorbonne, and a BA from the University of Kansas.
