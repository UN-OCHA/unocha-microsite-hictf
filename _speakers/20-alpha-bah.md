Alpha Bah is the Chief of IT Emergency Preparedness and Response and Global ETC Branch at the World Food Programme (WFP). He oversees the coordination and provision of live-saving ICT emergency services to support WFP’s operations and that of the humanitarian response community through the work of the Emergency Telecommunication Cluster (ETC) that WFP leads. The ETC is a global network of organizations that work together to provide shared communications services in humanitarian emergencies. Through its ETC2020 strategy, the cluster is evolving from being primarily a service provider, to broker, facilitator and convenor of technology in emergency response.

Prior to taking up this role in 2014, Alpha served as WFP’s regional IT advisor for the West, Central and Southern Africa regions, overseeing the coordination and delivery of ICT services and solutions in these regions. He had also served in North Korea, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, and in WFP’s headquarters. He has spent the last 25 years working in the ICT domain as a telecommunication specialist in the private sector and as an ICT specialist in the UN system, starting his UN career at UNDP.

Alpha holds a Bachelors degree in Electrical and Electronics engineering and a Masters degree in Management and in Information Systems.
