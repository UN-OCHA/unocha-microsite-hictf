Josh is passionate about using technology to enhance understanding and augment human cognitive capabilities. He believes that well-crafted technology and design has a unique ability to encourage long-term behavior change, enhance knowledge and mindfulness, and help us think at scale, with both data and other people. All are key to addressing the most pressing challenges societies and individuals face. He is pragmatically hopeful that effort and ingenuity can help create a better tomorrow.
