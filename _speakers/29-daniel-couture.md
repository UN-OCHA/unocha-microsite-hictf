Daniel Couture assumed the position of UNICEF CIO on 29 July 2015.

From 2012 to 2014, he served as the CIO for Zoetis, a global animal health company spun off from Pfizer in 2013. In this capacity, Daniel successfully built the Information Technology function to enable Zoetis to operate as a standalone company following its IPO, and delivered global systems to leverage processes and information across all business areas.

Prior to that, from 1984 to 2012, he had a distinguished career as a senior IT executive in Pfizer, holding CIO positions in the USA, Japan and Canada.  Working closely with the global and regional business teams and local country organizations, he developed strategic vision on business technology, and provided leadership to integrate and implement innovative IT solutions, maximizing the use of information technology across all business units in Pfizerâ€™s largest and fast growing markets around the world. Daniel has a proven track record of working collaboratively across a large organization and building strong, successful teams.
