Nick van Praag directs Ground Truth Solutions, an organization he founded in 2012 to help humanitarian actors systematically listen and respond to the people aid agencies set out to help.

Ground Truth Solutions is now working with a range of partners in some 15 countries, from Syrian theatre and the Philippines to Nepal and Haiti. It was recently commissioned by the OECD Secretariat to provide affected people’s views on the implementation of the Grand Bargain, a reform initiative launched at the 2016 World Humanitarian Summit, in 6 major humanitarian emergencies.

Van Praag’s previous career spans humanitarian and development work at the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the Aga Khan Development Network, and the World Bank.

His interest in promoting effective ways to engage affected people stems from his conviction that it can play a central role in transforming the way the humanitarian system works.

Nick van Praag, a British national with European convictions who lives in Austria, studied in France, the U.K. and Italy.
