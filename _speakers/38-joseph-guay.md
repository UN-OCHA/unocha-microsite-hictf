Joseph Guay is an independent consultant who has developed innovation strategies for the Global Alliance for Humanitarian Innovation (GAHI), World Vision’s Nepal Innovation Lab (NLab), the Global Protection Cluster at UNHCR, and the inter-agency Response Innovation Lab (RIL) drawing from Strategic and Evidence-based Design, Local Strategies Research, and systems thinking. Joe has helped developed information management solutions for human rights and humanitarian work, first at the Satellite Sentinel Project at the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, and later–through his teaching at Northeastern University’s Geographic Information Technology program—by providing remote-based information management and crowd-sourcing support for the Ebola pandemic (2014) and Nepal earthquake (2015) responses.
